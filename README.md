# Pexip Tutorial: Android

In this tutorial we will learn how to build a native videoconference app that will work in any Android device. This tutorial only have the code examples. The tutorial explaining all the steps and each small detail, can be found in our [Developer Portal](https://developer.pexip.com/mobile-sdks/android-overview).

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this tutorial you have to fulfill the following requirements:

* Basic Kotlin knowledge.
* Basic Android knowledge.
* Access to a Pexip Infinity deployment.

## Steps

In this project we define several steps. Each step is divided in two sub-steps `Exercise` for the starting point and `Solution` with the completed code. Each sub-step is located in a separated `branch`. This division allows the student to continue the tutorial from any point without having to develop the whole application and check the solution.

Here is a list of the available `branches` (only for `Exercise`):

* `Step.01-Exercise-Join-a-conference`: Build the minimum code for joining to a conference.
* `Step.02-Exercise-Use-a-pin`: Join to a conference that is protected by a PIN.
* `Step.03-Exercise-Mute-audio-and-video`: Mute the user microphone and camera.
